# Star Wars Project

For my final project, I will be exploring the details of the Star Wars galaxy. I am most interested in the planets and people of the galaxy far, far, away. I will start by gathering and cleaning data from a Star Wars API. I will then create visuals, run analysis, and form conclusions from the data collected. 

For my full code and to view the data, visit this repo: [Final Project](https://github.com/boi-andy/final_project)

To see how I gathered and cleaned my data, visit my blog post [Data Collection for Star Wars](https://boi-andy.github.io/my-blog/2023/11/10/data-collection.html).

For a description and analysis of each graph, visit my blog post [EDA of Planets and People](https://boi-andy.github.io/my-blog/2023/11/14/EDA.html)
