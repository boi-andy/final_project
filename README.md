# final_project

This is my final project for STAT 386. I will be exploring the different types of planets in the Star Wars galaxy. Part of this research will include the planet's size, teerrain, and population. I will also be using data that show what characters are from each planet and the character's features, including type of species, height, weight, and home world.
