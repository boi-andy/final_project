# EDA Feedback

SHA number of original EDA blog post: 727fe230ff67e9acf14adc70f2150777e239ad32

## Feedback

The main feedback I recieved was to make the blog post more readable with better spacing and possibily better colors. I was also told that I should add more comparisons of categorical data. Otheer suggestions included better descriptions of why I make specific comparisons and better analysis of the comparisons that I made.

## Improvements

I was able to follow the feedback given and make the blog post more readable. I decided to not add more color as I think it would make the blog look overwhelming. I did enhance my descriptions of the comparisons as I made. I explained why I wanted to see if a planet's diamater and population are correlated. I also went more into depth on the analysis of each visual as thee findings were actually quite interesting. I was able to explain that knowledge of this EDA could save millions of lives in the Star Wars galaxy. I also addeed more EDA on the people of the universe as it showed the similarities of the Star Wars galaxy and ours.
