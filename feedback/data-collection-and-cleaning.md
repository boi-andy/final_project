# Data Collection Blog Feedback

SHA number of original Data Collection blog post: 92339ad4d0364018a7130c1656a3d475f6e7c9c9

My original blog post was very simple as I don't think I full understood the assignment. I created a blog post that shared my story of the struggles I had when I began my search for data and how I finally selected my topic. I did not have any code included and did not mention anything about cleaning my code.

## Feedback

I was able to recieve feedback from classmates that obviously understood the assignment more clearly. They suggested that I include more information on the API I was using and my motivation for why I slected the data that I did. I was also encouraged to add blocks of code, showing how the data was put into dataframes and the methods I used to clean the data. I also also lacked any information including ethical problems.

## Improvements

I used the feedback recieved as a checklist. I started by adding an explanation why I chose the data that I did and what I was planning to do with it. I added blocks of code that showed how the data was recieved and how I was able to clean the data so that it would be easier to use. I also added a paragraph about the ethical descision I had to make. 

I thought it would be helpful to add visuals of the dataframe that I was able to clean. I actually eneded up mkaing two different dataframes and cleaned them both. I did this with hopes to merge and compare the data. I was able to use all the feedback that was given to me in a veery useful manner. Without the feedback, my post would have not had any visuals or blocks of code.
