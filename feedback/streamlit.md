# Streamlit Feedback

SHA number of an early Streamlit app: cd7ffc8064c6e643864d4c3c5b1fd6f6d7d28a44

## Feedback

The most important feedback that I recieved from my peers was that the app took a very long time to load. It was taking up to a full minute or so to load the graphs. Other feedback included better titles and organization of visuals. The last part of feedback I recieved was to add a variety of interactive tools. I was using only drop down visuals

## Improvements

I started my identifying why my app was taking so long. It was because I was gathering data from the API everytime the app was launched. To solve this, I went back into my code and created .csv files for my data. I put those .csv files on github and chnaged the path url to those .csvs so my app would run more quickly. I then decided to add more sliders and custom text box in my streamlit app. I created titles for each of my visuals with a link at the top to my EDA blog post which contains a description and analysis of each visual. I also added a final dropdown menu to see the characteristics of each person in the persons .csv.
