# Topic Selection Feedback

I originally selected movie data for my project. I got my data from kaggle from an already made dataset. I was originally planning on making a very basic project as I wasn't comfortable with webscrapping and the use of APIs.

## Feedback

I recieved feedback encouraging me to take on the challenge of scrapping information from websites. I was also reccomended to look at the IMDb API and get data from there. They ensured me that there was plenty of data on movies and box office sales that I could use.

## Improvements

This feedback motivated me to stretch my skills with webscrapping. I looked over many wikipedia pages but I couldn't find what I was looking for. I then checked the IMDb API and quickly found out that you had to pay for it. I then tried to use third party movie APIs but all of them also required payment or were really buggy.

While looking on the IMDb page, I kept seeing Star Wars films. I looked up if there were any Star Wars APIs and that is when I finally selected my topic. I found an API that had all the data I wanted for my project. I was really grateful that my peers pushed me past what I thought were my limits. I was able to successfully pull thee information from the API. This is talked about more in the Data Collection feedback.
